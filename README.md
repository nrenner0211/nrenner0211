# Hi, I'm Niki!

## About Me

- 👋 I’m Niki, front-end developer learning my way to full stack web development, one project at a time. Currently, I'm learning `Next.js` && `Tailwind`. 

- 🎓 I graduated a Full Stack Development Bootcamp in October '22, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript foundations as well as best practices for creating a website. The bootcamp set me on the rewarding path of teaching myself programming.

- 🎨 I have a trained eye for details such as line spacing, font size, and padding. Skilled at crafting optimized, custom components with React and Tailwind CSS. Thanks to my experience as a freelance web developer, I’m also skilled at time management, documentation, and organization.
